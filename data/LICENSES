Details:
  Made using tiles from Super Mario Bros 3, which are copyrighted by
  Nintendo, ripped by pucifer27. This work was done using Tiled; you can
  more easily edit it with Tiled via "background.tmx", the source TMX
  file. To facilitate this, the tiles used are also included as
  "smb3tiles8ao_.png".

  It is my firm belief that this use of the Super Mario Bros 3 graphics
  is fair use under U.S. copyright law, due to the transformativeness
  and non-commercial nature of the use.

Details:
  This is the font used in Super Mario Bros, ripped by Parakarry. It is
  included for use in Kitten Command.

  Because this is only a typeface, it is not subject to copyright under
  U.S. law (see Eltra Corp. v. Ringer). Even if it were, it is my firm
  belief that this use of the font would be fair use, due to the
  transformativeness and non-commercial nature of the use.
